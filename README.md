Measures theoretical vs. experimental rate of capacitor discharging 

Files and Directory descriptions:

/Data/: contains measured data for Electric Potential vs. Time)
/figures/: contains .png files of graphs generated by graphs.py)
/scripts/: (contains .py scripts)
(other files)
results.txt: saves percent errors generated by data_analysis.py
Capacitor_Discharge.pdf: Typsetted derivation of capacitor discharge formula 

.py Descriptions: 

graphs.py: 
Given a csv dataset of Electric Potential vs. Time, generates graphs of V vs. T and ln(V) vs. T. Saves .png to 'figures' directory.

data_analysis.py: 
Using a linear regression, calculates the slope for ln(V) vs. T and compares it to the theoretical value of -1/(RC), saves percent error to 'results.txt'.
See 'Capacitor_Discharge.pdf' for the derivation of the theoretical equation. 

CSV formatting requirements: 
-Name: '[resistance value]-ohms.csv'
-Attributes: Time_(s), Potential_(V)

How to use scripts via command line: 
python [script path] [csv path]
